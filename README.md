A payment gateway is a technology used by merchants to accept debit or credit card purchases from customers. The term includes not only the physical card-reading devices found in brick-and-mortar retail stores but also the payment processing portals found in online stores.
In this project, I have created a demo website to order food and fill in all the necessary details which will be sent as a mail to me. Also, you can make the payment through the website.
This project is created with the intention of learning how basic online websites work and how the payment is processed through the payment gateway.
